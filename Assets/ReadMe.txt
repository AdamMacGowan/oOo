Breathing Rate information from Adam Barton:
--------------------------------------------
I'd say it makes sense to slow down the breathing over time a little. When there's no major distractions/interactions involved  it's probably easier to follow. I think with ripple effect we started at 10 breath/min which I think is a bit too fast. I reckon starting at ~8 and slowing to ~5 will be good. Although that's tentative, depending on the length of the experience etc.
